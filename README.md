# Classifier-ML-Project
Created a Classifier ML Project to analysis a data set of various health indicators and predicting whether or not the subject has heart disease based on these indicators.

Figure 1: A ROC Curve produced during the analysis portion of this project.

Figure 2: A Confusion Matrix indicating the tp, fp, tn, and fn performance of the model.

Heart Disease ML Analysis.py: The main python file where I created my ML classifiers, evaluated their performance, and produced visual representations of the model performance.

heart_statlog_cleveland_hungary_final.csv: Data set used for this project.
